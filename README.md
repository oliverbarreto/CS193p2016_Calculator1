#CS193P - Developing iOS 9 Apps with Swift 2.2
This repository contains code that follows demos done during classes and that solve the assigments proposed on CS193P course Spring 2016 lectures. 


## Stanford University Class CS193P - Spring 2016
This course was launched by Stanford and iTunesU on March 28, 2016 and is hosted by the outstanding Prof. Paul Hegarty.

The course video sessions and materials can be watched and downloaded from [CS193P Online Course in iTunesU](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-9-apps-swift/id1104579961). [iTunesU CS193P RSS Feed](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-9-apps-swift/id1104579961)

Some samples and resources are downloaded from [CS193P official website](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/). 


##Community 
Since online users following the course via Internet and iTunesU cannot access the community created on Piazza.com, a community has been set up in [CS193P Public Google Group](http://bit.ly/23idR2B) and [Twitter](http://bit.ly/1Urm1VM). Join the community to collaborate and share help.

You can also get help in this [blog (cs193p.m2m.at)](http://cs193p.m2m.at/cs193p-project-1-assignment-1-task-1-winter-2015) that attempts to provide possible solutions for the assignments (of previous years) in order to help non-Stanford students when they get stuck. If you are a Stanford student, please do not uses these solutions to cheat.

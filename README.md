This repository contains code that follows demos done during classes and that solve the assigments proposed on CS193P course Spring 2016 lectures. 


## Stanford University Class CS193P - Spring 2016
This course was launched by Stanford and iTunesU on March 28, 2016 and is hosted by the outstanding Prof. Paul Hegarty.

The course video sessions and materials can be watched and downloaded from [CS193P Online Course in iTunesU](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-9-apps-swift/id1104579961). [iTunesU CS193P RSS Feed](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-9-apps-swift/id1104579961)
